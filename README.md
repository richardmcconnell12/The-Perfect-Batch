# The-Perfect-Batch

## General Info/Purpose 
My final full-stack capstone project for Nashville Software School. My application is designed to help users search for recipes to make, and add new recipes for other users to try. The target audience is those who like to try and make their own recipes from scratch. It's the answer to the age old question "How did you make that?" or "I made this again, but it may not taste the same." Thus I give you "the Perfect Batch." 

## Installing 
Clone repo using git clone https://github.com/richardmcconnell12/The-Perfect-Batch.git open Virtual Studio and run ThePerfectBatch, create a new account and login.

Feel free to use my application and test it's functionality at will.
